# eNSP Topologies in Network Engineer Course

This project contains several network topologies and corresponding notes. It is the practice result from the course [网络工程师200集全套视频教程 (Network Engineer video tutorials (All 200 episodes))](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZT411j7Tj). For example, the single-arm routing topology and its note.

The practice tool for building topologies in this course is eNSP from Huawei. All network and test is built in this tool. Many thanks for the amazing tool.

Although the tutorial is taught in Chinese, all the project's content is in English as it already has had some offical Chinese demo.

## README (Chinese)

这个项目包含了[网络工程师200集全套视频教程](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZT411j7Tj)的部分练习结果. 即, 一些拓扑图和笔记. 例如, 单臂路由的拓扑图.

绘制拓扑图的工具是华为的eNSP. 非常感谢这款强悍的工具.

由于官方提供了中文版的全套资料, 重复是无意义的. 因此, 所有内容以英文撰写, 以供任何需要英文信息的朋友比对查找.

## Project Structure

Each folder under the root is corresponding to one type of topology.

In each folder, 

- a markdown file with the same name as the parent folder keeps all note.
- a child folder with the same name as the parent folder keeps the eNSP file.
